# PYCFSCape
A QTGUI for the Python VPK Library.
## Why?
Becuase i'm a linux user, and also a Source Engine modder. It's suprisingly tedious to get GCFScape to work with Linux (Wine on its own doesn't work, so i gave up.), and i Decided "What's the harm?".

## So then, what'll i need?
If i've done it correctly, (don't count on it), then You'll simply need PyQt5 & VPK. (sys is a standard module, iirc)
(For all of these, `--user` is optional)
To get PyQt5, simply do;
`` pip install PyQt5 --user ``
And for VPK,
`` pip install vpk --user``
And then you just run main.py and it should work.


##What exactly is this branch?
Essentially, it began as a branch to try and mimic the original GCFScape. But, its sort-of become the Testing branch.

If there's ever a re-write of this program, you can damn well bet it'll be in this branch.
